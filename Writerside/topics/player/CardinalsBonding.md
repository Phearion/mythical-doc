# ❤️ About Cardinals

Cardinals are your partners in battle, each offering unique abilities and bonuses based on their type.

Lore: Cardinals are celestial beings coming from another dimension to the realm of Mythical. They are guides for the chosen one. You are the chosen one and so are your Luminals.
Cardinals came to you or will come to you thanks to your Luminals and their unique personalities. They will then bond with you and help you in your journey.

For now, the level doesn't impact anything but will be used in the future for more features.

## ABOUT: SYMBIOSIS (Affinity Score)
Each time you bond with a Cardinal, you will increase your affinity score. The higher the affinity, the more possibilities you will have in the future.
