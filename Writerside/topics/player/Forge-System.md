# ⚒️ Luminal Forge System

### Power Scaling

- Each fusion increases base stats
- No fusion limit
- Stats compound with each fusion

## Strategic Fusion

### Fairy Advantage
- More common = easier to obtain
- Faster power growth
- Can exceed base Mystic stats

### Rarity Comparison

1. **Fairy Fusion**
    - Quick progression
    - Resource efficient
    - High availability

2. **Enchanted Fusion**
    - Balanced growth
    - Good power curve

3. **Mystic Fusion**
    - Highest potential
    - Resource intensive
    - Slow progression

### Resource Optimization
- Prioritize main team
- Save rare Luminals
- Plan fusion path

### Dev note:

- The Forge system is designed to provide a strategic progression path for Luminals.
- For now, we are away of the high cost of each fusion, and are working on balancing the resource economy as well as the power scaling.
