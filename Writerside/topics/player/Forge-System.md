# ⚒️ Luminal Forge System

### Power Scaling

- Each fusion increases base stats
- No fusion limit
- Stats compound with each fusion

## Strategic Fusion

### Rarity Comparison

1. **Fairy Fusion**
    - Quick progression (More common = easier to obtain)
    - Resource efficient (High cost to fuse many fairy to get same power as Mystic)
    - Can exceed base Mystic stats with enough fusions

2. **Enchanted Fusion**
    - Balanced growth
    - Good power curve

3. **Mystic Fusion**
    - Highest potential
    - Resource intensive (hard to obtain a Mystic)
    - Slow progression

### Resource Optimization
- Prioritize main team
- Save rare Luminals
- Plan fusion path

### Dev note:

- The Forge system is designed to provide a strategic progression path for Luminals.
- For now, we are aware of the high cost of each fusion, and are working on balancing the resource economy as well as the power scaling.
