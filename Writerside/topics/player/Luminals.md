As for now, we do not have any Luminals related type-advantages system. But we are planning to add it in the future.
This is a complex system that will require a lot of testing and balancing. 
This system will be out in the update v0.7.0. 
Types will be used in any battle system, including hunts battles, PVE and PVP.

Here is a sneak mermaid of the type-advantages system:
